During the lifecycle of an actor, there are 3 types of events -
1. The actor is created and started -start event
2. Actor is restarted  - restart event
3. Actor is stopped - stop event.

Start event:
When an actor instance is created, the actor will be started. The preStart is the called just before the actor is
started.

Stop event:
The stop event indicates the end of the actor life cycle and occurs once either by using the stop method on the
ActorSystem and ActorContext objects or by sending a PoisonPill message to an actor. The postStop is called
just before the actor is terminated. It is counterpart of the preStart. After the actor is stopped, ActorRef 
is redirected to the deadLettersActorRef of the actor system (special ActorRef) which receives all messages sent to
dead actors

Restart event:
In this event, instance of the actor is replaced. When the restart occurs, the preRestart method of the crashed actor 
instance is invoked. In this, the crashed actor instance is able to store it's current state before its replaced 
by the new actor instance.
